# Time Complexity & Asymptotic notations

### What is Time Complexity?
Time complexity is the study of efficiency of an Algorithm.

How time taken to execute an algorithm grows with the size of input.

Example:- Consider two developers who created an algorithm to sort n numbers in an array. Shubham and Rohan did this independently.

When code was executed for input size n, following results were recorded.

| No. of elements (n) | Shubham's Algo (ms) | Rohan's Algo (ms) |
| :--------- | :---------: | :---------: |
| 10 elements | 90 | 122 |
| 70 elements | 110 | 124 |
| 110 elements | 180 | 131 |
| 10,000 elements | 2000 | 800 |

We can see that initially Shubham's Algorithm was shining for smaller input but as the number of elements increases rohan's algortihm performs optimally.
